## 📖 About

Tamagotchi is an interactive web application that brings your beloved objects to life as digital companions. Inspired by the classic virtual pet, this modern reimagining helps you preserve memories by transforming photos of meaningful objects into nostalgic pixel art creatures with personality.

Using Claude AI's advanced natural language processing, the app analyzes your written stories to automatically detect emotions—happy, nostalgic, sad, or dreaming. Each memory companion is enhanced with customizable googly eyes that follow your cursor, creating an interactive bond between you and your cherished possessions.

Built with privacy in mind, all your companions are stored locally in your browser. No servers, no databases—just you and your Tamagotchi memories. The pixel art aesthetic combined with AI-powered emotion analysis creates a unique digital memory box that celebrates the emotional connections we form with the objects that matter most to us.
